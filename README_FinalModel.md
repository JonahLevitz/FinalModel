# FinalModel - Emergency Detection System

## 🚨 Working Emergency Detection System

This repository contains a fully functional emergency detection system that can detect three types of emergencies in real-time using webcam input.

## ✅ Working Features

### Detected Emergency Types:
1. **🚗 Car Crashes** - Detects vehicle accidents and collisions
2. **🔥 Fires** - Detects fire and smoke incidents  
3. **👤 Fainted People** - Detects unconscious or collapsed individuals

### Performance:
- **Real-time detection** using webcam feed
- **Optimized processing** every 2 seconds for smooth performance
- **High confidence detections** with automatic image saving
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (tested on macOS)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites:
```bash
# Install Python 3.11 (required for PyTorch compatibility)
python3.11 -m pip install torch torchvision ultralytics opencv-python
```

### Run the Detection System:
```bash
python3.11 test_fast_webcam.py
```

### Controls:
- **'q'** - Quit the application
- **'s'** - Save current frame
- **'p'** - Force immediate processing

## 📊 Model Performance

### Training Details:
- **Model**: YOLOv8 trained for 20 epochs
- **Classes**: 9 emergency types (focused on 3 main ones)
- **Dataset**: Combined emergency datasets
- **Performance**: mAP50 of ~50% with good recall

### Detection Confidence:
- **Car Crashes**: 0.3+ confidence threshold
- **Fires**: 0.6+ confidence threshold  
- **Fainted People**: 0.6+ confidence threshold

## 📁 Key Files

- `test_fast_webcam.py` - Main detection script (WORKING)
- `models/emergency_detection.pt` - Trained model (18.4MB)
- `detections/` - Saved detection images

## 🎯 Recent Success

**All three emergency types are now working:**
- ✅ Fire detection: 0.71 confidence
- ✅ Person fainted: 0.73 confidence  
- ✅ Car crash: 0.65 confidence

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Model Architecture:
- **Base Model**: YOLOv8n
- **Input Size**: 640x640
- **Classes**: 9 emergency types
- **Optimization**: CPU inference for compatibility

### Dependencies:
```
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
ultralytics>=8.0.0
opencv-python>=4.8.0
numpy<2.0.0
```

## 📸 Detection Examples

The system automatically saves detection images to the `detections/` folder with timestamps and confidence scores.

## 🚨 Emergency Response

This system is designed for:
- **Real-time monitoring** of emergency situations
- **Automatic alerting** when emergencies are detected
- **Image capture** for incident documentation
- **Low-latency processing** for immediate response

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integration with emergency services APIs
- Multi-camera support
- Alert system integration
- Dashboard for monitoring multiple feeds
